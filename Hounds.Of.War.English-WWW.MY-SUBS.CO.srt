Colonel, there is

-Oh, it certainly is a surprise.

66

-That's all you have to say?
-How'd it happen?

71
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:54,642
-Well--
-You need me to explain

72
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:55,776
the process?

73
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:56,811
I mean, I can if you want.

74
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:58,045
I just figured
at your advanced age,

75
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,680
you'd know this shit already.
-At my advanced age?

76
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,983
- Yeah.
- Stop it.

77

It means a lot.

78
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:07,388
-I always come, man. Always.

79
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,724
We had an agreement.
-I know. I know.

80
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,692
There's money to be made.
Good money.

81
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,361
-Yeah.
-We-can-retire kind of money.

82
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:14,762
Well, I am retired,

83
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:15,997
and there's always
money to be made

84
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:17,732
but we agreed we wouldn't work
for this son of a bitch.

85
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,633
- I know, but I got--
- Guys.

86
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:21,936
Come on. No business talk yet.
Let's go.

87
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:24,171
-No.
-Okay.

88
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,373
Blame him.

89
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:27,975
-Yeah, always.
What are you doing?

90
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,448
-You sure you wanna
do this, man?

91
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:35,683
You're having a baby.

92
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,251
-Hey, it's all good, man.

93
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,819
I got this.

94
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,054
We got this.

95
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:42,289
You gotta trust me, okay?

96
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,357
-Yeah, I trust you.

97
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:44,558
-You trust me?

98
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,093
-I trust you.

99
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,161
-Good.

100
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,064
-Are you okay with this?

101
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:52,299
-Are you okay with this?

102
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,090
-You need a woman in your life.

103
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:34,161
-I had one.
It didn't work out.

104
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,297
-Pity. I miss Selina.

105
00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:38,132
I heard she has
her own outfit now in Rome.

106
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:40,301
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I heard that.

107
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:41,468
It's none of my business.

108
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,807
-You're gonna love
the new place.

109
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,176
It's got a gym, pool,
private beach.

110
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:50,344
We call it The Fortress.

111
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:51,546
It's like a five-star resort.

112
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:53,214
It sounds great.

113
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:54,848
-Does it have a nursery?

114
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:06,820
-Yo! Ladies!

115
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,591
Yeah!

116
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:12,026
-Wow. Jesus,
Mary and the Saints.

117
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,894
-You've really scraped
the bottom of the barrel!

118
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,697
-Now you know
how I fucking feel.

119
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,298
-Oh, yeah.
-Welcome back, brother.

120
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:20,200
- You guys are getting fat!
- Yeah.

121
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,468
How are you?
Good to see you, brother.

122
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:23,672
You too.
You too. Get over here.

123

You're all getting fat!

124
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,578
-Alright, he's here. Gotta go.

125
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:43,157
Ah! Boom! Boom!

126
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,729
-I swore I heard you say
that you quit.

127
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,196
-I did quit.
-No, no. I believe

128
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:52,099
his exact words were,
"You'd sooner find me dead

129
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,100
-than on another mission."
-Another mission.

130
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,134
Yeah.

131
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,236
-This...
is my very last mission.

132
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,640
-One more mission.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

133
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,542
-Hey, look who made it.

134
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,618
-That's a great suit.

135
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,086
You running for governor?

136
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,489
-It's time for you to start
believing in something again.

137
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,893
I'm very sorry about
what happened in Syria.

138
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,228
I really am.

139
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:23,997
-I lost a lot of good men.

140
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:28,469
-It's always sad
when the shit hits the fan.

141
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:33,907
-Shit didn't hit the fan,
Colonel.

142
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,242
You fucked up.

143
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,412
We almost didn't
make it out alive.

144
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,517
I'm gonna do this
one more time, Colonel.

145
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:45,052
For my brother.

146
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,789
And then we're done.

147
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,390
I don't wanna see you again.

148
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,928
-The dead can't return...

149
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,298
but the living...

150
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,001

both have a strong interest

163
00:16:16,878 --> 00:16:18,145
in this region.

164
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,115
He needs to be stopped

165
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,753
before we're dragged
into a proxy war.

166
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:58,620
-Alright, boys.

167
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,557
Let's go hunting.

168
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,037
<i>Now, as always,</i>
<i>you're gonna have</i>

169
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:52,239
<i>a specific task, each of you.</i>

170
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:55,142
<i>You're gonna be dropped</i>
<i>three clicks from the target</i>

171
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,544
<i>on the outskirts of Sirte.</i>

172
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,048
<i>Your drop-off is your pick-up.</i>

173
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,382
<i>If you're not back</i>
<i>by 0300 hours,</i>

174
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,853
<i>prepare for a nice long hike</i>
<i>back to Tunisia.</i>

175
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:52,359
-Khalid has taken over
the Grand Hotel

176
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:56,130
that was built by Qaddafi
to house world leaders.

177
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,533
He's transformed
this bombed-out hotel

178
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:00,568
into his military headquarters.

179
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:03,037
-Question. Is the Jacuzzi
still working?

180
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:04,872
'Cause I might wanna
soak my balls

181
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:06,908
after this fight.

182
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:11,145
This is not
some bush league militia

183
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:12,479
you're gonna face.

184
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,415
Our guy has acquired
an envious arsenal.

185
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,518
These men are well-equipped.

186
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:19,153
You'll be facing a growing army

187
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:21,388
of professional soldiers.

188
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,263
<i>Now our first task</i>
<i>is to isolate Khalid.</i>

189
00:20:48,716 --> 00:20:50,250
<i>We need to cut off</i>
<i>his communications</i>

190
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,285
<i>with the outside world.</i>

191
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,387
Forty feet underground

192
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:57,024
beneath the Grand Hall,
lies his bunker.

193
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,425
This is where
you will find him.

194
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:00,661
This is where
you will kill him.

195
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,898
Khalid is engaged in a war
on two fronts as we speak.

196
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:06,801
And most of his men
are engaged in battle.

197
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:09,369
Satellite images show us
that his bunker is protected

198
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:13,406
only by the elite
of the Sidi Omar Brigade.

199
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:16,110
Twenty men, heavily armed
rabid fanatics.

200
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,179
Rosebud and Femi,
you're gonna set up

201
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,081
on the third floor.

202
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:21,182
Guard the whole perimeter.

203
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:41,235
<i>There are</i>
<i>security cameras</i>

204
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:43,671
<i>that are throughout</i>
<i>the building,</i>

205
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:46,874
<i>so we're gonna need to have</i>
<i>Hollywood set up shop</i>

206
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:50,144
<i>in the electrical substation</i>
<i>at the back of the hotel.</i>

207
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:53,281
<i>We need to be invisible.</i>

208
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,004
-You sure this will work?

209
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:19,372
One hundred percent sure.

210
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,440
-Yeah, right.

211
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,577
-It's the only way

212
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:25,445
to get into
an air-gapped system.

213
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:29,349
We need to increase
the strain of the power supply

214
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:34,288
on the solar-metered
ultrasonic frequencies

215
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:38,125
and transport...
our information.

216
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:41,295
It's fucking genius.

217
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,030
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Blah, blah, blah.

218
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,199
It's all Chinese to me.
Just make sure you get it.

219
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,567
-It's physics.

220
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:01,883
-Room clear.

221
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:18,666
Set.

222
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,076
-In the nest, over.

223
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:33,781
<i>Hold up.</i>

224
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:35,883
<i>We got a guard</i>
<i>upstairs from you.</i>

225
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,623
<i>Hollywood, how are we doing?</i>

226
00:23:42,723 --> 00:23:44,659
<i>Need help with those cameras.</i>

227
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,545
-Sharpen the arrows,

228
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,446
for it's the vengeance
of the Lord.

229
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:15,423
-Hey, brother.

230
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:16,390
Can you tell him
your nice speech,

231
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:17,658
just a little bit faster?

232
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:25,099
-Father, forgive them
for they know not what they do.

233
00:24:29,503 --> 00:24:30,805
<i>All clear.</i>

234
00:24:55,796 --> 00:24:58,532
-One between you
and the target.

235
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:12,947
I need to update my equipment.

236
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:16,550
-Something feels off.
My Spidey sense is tingling.

237
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:25,226
-And here comes
the poor man's light show.

238
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:30,231
Go!

239
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:44,178
Okay, guys.

240
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:47,915
We made it. Khalid is ours.

241
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:06,901
The target is gone.

242
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:09,303
I repeat,
the target is gone.

243
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,705
-What the fuck is going on?
-Um...

244
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:23,084
-Oh, fuck.

245
00:26:30,324 --> 00:26:31,592
-Fuck!

246
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:44,105
-It's a trap.
-They're everywhere.

247
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,372
Come on! Get out!

248
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,542
-Eyes! Eyes!
Look at me! You good?

249
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:50,644
-I'm okay.
-Alright. Breathe. Breathe. Go!

250
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:10,131
-Contact front!

251
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:11,432
We need to move!

252
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:12,633
We need to move now!

253
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:15,102
-I'm coming.

254
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:49,670
-Move! Move! Move!

255
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:56,410
-Put your guns down!

256
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:08,055
-Tell the Lord to do
what he can to save us now!

257
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:09,890
-The Lord is always with us.

258
00:28:46,695 --> 00:28:47,562
-Break right!

259
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:53,834
Shit!

260
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,202
Eddie, stay with me, brother.

261
00:28:55,302 --> 00:28:58,138
- Santa Maria...

262
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,425
We gotta move!

263
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:19,927
No!

264
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:54,395
-RPG!

265
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:01,121
- I was hoping you'd say that.

266
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:13,000
-Move! Faster!
-I can't!

267
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,903
Move! You fucking can move.

268
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:16,270
Move!

269
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:26,280
- You good?
- Oh, no. I'm bad.

270
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,982
- How bad?
- Real fucking bad.

271
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:36,223
-I guess you're not gonna
leave me, huh?

272
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:39,828
-You go, I go.

273
00:32:39,928 --> 00:32:42,597
- Oh, fuck you.

274
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:07,287
Fuck. I'm out.

275
00:33:13,695 --> 00:33:15,530
I'm sorry, brother.

276
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:26,641
-No!

277
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:42,222
-No, no, no! No.

278
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:44,124
I got you.
Look at me!

279
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:45,994
What did you do?
What the fuck did you do?

280
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:47,394
What did you do?!

281
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:49,697
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes. You're okay.

282
00:33:49,797 --> 00:33:51,599
Hey, you're okay!

283
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,801
Fuck.

284
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:00,040
Tommy. Tommy...

285
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:09,684
Fuck.

286
00:34:58,032 --> 00:34:59,734
-Any news yet?

287
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,002
-I still haven't heard anything.

288
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:02,369
Still waiting.

289
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:06,406
How's the baby?

290
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:10,645
-Good. I just...

291
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,514
I just have this bad feeling.

292
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:20,153
-Why don't you
run on back to bed?

293
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:24,592
I'll come get you a soon
as the bird picks 'em up, okay?

294
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:29,396
Everything's gonna be fine.

295
00:36:05,066 --> 00:36:06,166
<i>American President Lane</i>

296
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:08,069
<i>has just touched down</i>
<i>in Portugal,</i>

297
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:09,637
making his first official stop

298
00:36:09,737 --> 00:36:12,040
of "Vaccine, Not Bullets"
European tour.

299
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,108
All eyes on President Lane

300
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:15,843
as he breaks bread
for the first time

301
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:18,345
with Portuguese Socialist
President, Ana Nazario.

302
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:21,381
His female counterpart has,
for years, been openly critical

303
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:23,483
of U.S. foreign policy.
-Champagne, sir?

304
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:26,020
President Lane
was all smiles this morning

305
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,555
as he insisted
with his counterpart

306
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:30,692
that his patriotism
has a humane face.

307
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:09,496
-Hello. Shall we dance?

308
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:13,968
-Not now. Thank you.

309
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:49,637
-Thank you so much.

310
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:52,707
Thanks.

311
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:57,111
-No one's arguing
with his reputation

312
00:37:57,211 --> 00:38:00,047
but given our very public stance
on international relations,

313
00:38:00,148 --> 00:38:02,382
his history is toxic.

314
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:04,719
-It's just that, sir, history.

315
00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:07,588
What you're getting from Hart
is experience, results.

316
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:10,591
-I'm not sure we can afford
his kind of results.

317
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:13,227
-He's taken care of
our problems without flinching.

318
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:16,329
Iraq, Libya, Chechnya.
I can keep going.

319
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:18,099
-Oh, goddamn it.
I'm trying to get the world

320
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,834
to fall in love
with America again.

321
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:22,537
Hart is always bad news.

322
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:26,908
And when the press
hears of this...

323
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:31,344
-They don't need
to hear anything.

324
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:34,148
I can delay the announcement
to the outside world.

325
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:37,652
Forever.

326
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:39,921
-Well, I'm not sure.

327
00:38:41,622 --> 00:38:44,959
-Respectfully,
Hart is not the brand, sir.

328
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:48,495
You are. He will be strictly
behind the scenes.

329
00:38:48,596 --> 00:38:50,031
-You really trust him?

330
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:52,533
-With my life.

331
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:55,069
-Feels to me like
we're inviting the bull

332
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:56,270
into the China shop.

333
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:57,839
-Look, I get it.
The world hates him,

334
00:38:57,939 --> 00:38:59,674
but we need him.

335
00:38:59,774 --> 00:39:02,743
We can't just sit on our behinds
and hope for the best.

336
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:05,847
Singing "Kumbaya"
won't deter our enemies.

337
00:39:05,947 --> 00:39:08,348
-"Vaccines, Not Bullets"
is what we're selling.

338
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:09,584
-That's correct, sir.

339
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:11,252
That-that--
That's what we're selling,

340
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,820
but behind the scenes,

341
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,590
we need to be ready
for any eventuality.

342
00:39:20,228 --> 00:39:21,696
We're hearing chatter.

343
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:25,066
Dangerous chatter.

344
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,366
-What do you mean?

345
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:28,269
What have you heard?

346
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:32,472
Mostly whispers because
we're flying blind.

347
00:39:33,774 --> 00:39:36,878
That's why I'm pushing
"he who shall not be named"

348
00:39:39,113 --> 00:39:41,716
to avoid a 9/11-level event...

349
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:45,853
on your watch.

350
00:39:45,953 --> 00:39:46,921
-Sir...

351
00:39:48,488 --> 00:39:50,825
Hart is merely
an insurance policy.

352
00:39:52,492 --> 00:39:54,662
A heavily classified

353
00:39:55,997 --> 00:39:57,430
insurance policy.

354
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,868
-Good,

355
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:02,904
because if the media
get wind of this,

356
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:06,107
my reputation,
everything I've built--

357
00:40:06,207 --> 00:40:07,474
-It won't happen.

358
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:10,077
I won't let it.

359
00:40:15,216 --> 00:40:16,717
-We'll give him a London post.

360
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:18,786
The Lair.

361
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:22,290
Just for a trial run.

362
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,624
-Very good, sir.

363
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:51,552
-We are at war,
ladies and gentlemen.

364
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:54,755
An undeclared war,
but a war nonetheless.

365
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:59,393
Our enemies aim
to topple the systems

366
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:02,462
that keep our very way
of life in check

367
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,800
and I would sooner die

368
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,002
than let those systems fail.

369
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:18,579
Let us begin.

370
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:10,598
Check the cameras.

371
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:50,638
-Go and give that bastard
a nice warm welcome.

372
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:11,725
-Can you tell Selina,
"Ryder's here"?

373
00:43:11,826 --> 00:43:13,594
-There is no Selina here.

374
00:44:52,661 --> 00:44:54,929
-I hope I didn't
mess up your night.

375
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:59,333
-Was this really necessary?

376
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:05,806
They told me...

377
00:45:07,509 --> 00:45:08,577
you were dead.

378
00:45:09,977 --> 00:45:11,212
Well, it's happy...

379
00:45:12,112 --> 00:45:14,048
Well, happy to see you too.

380
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,187
-You know, to, um,

381
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,425
tell me you're alive...

382
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,298
I was busy.

383
00:45:44,812 --> 00:45:47,047
-I cried for you.

384
00:45:54,689 --> 00:45:56,123
Stupid me.

385
00:46:01,895 --> 00:46:03,197
Cut him loose.

386
00:46:21,382 --> 00:46:22,550
-So why are you here?

387
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:25,185
-Revenge.

388
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:27,821
-When isn't it?

389
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:32,393
-They're dead.

390
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:36,263
All of them.

391
00:46:39,768 --> 00:46:41,468
-And the baby?

392
00:47:02,724 --> 00:47:04,858
Who?

393
00:47:05,794 --> 00:47:06,960
Hart.

394
00:47:09,531 --> 00:47:10,964
-He's untouchable now.

395
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:12,600
Runs with the big dogs now.

396
00:47:12,701 --> 00:47:14,468
-I don't want him.

397
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:18,939
I'm gonna break the system.

398
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,344
-You're out of your mind.

399
00:47:27,615 --> 00:47:29,350
Nobody breaks the system.

400
00:47:36,624 --> 00:47:39,026
So what does all this
have to do with me?

401
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:41,796
-I need a team.

402
00:47:41,895 --> 00:47:44,331
I need you, Selina.

403
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:53,340
-Good luck, Ryder.

404
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,311
I'm sorry I missed your funeral.

405
00:47:58,813 --> 00:48:00,548
I promise to attend
the next one.

406
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:13,695
-Oh...

407
00:48:13,795 --> 00:48:15,095
-Are you gonna make it?

408
00:48:17,565 --> 00:48:19,333
-Ha ha!

409
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:21,468
-Good job, Grandpa.
-Nice move.

410
00:48:21,569 --> 00:48:23,337
-Uh-huh.

411
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:24,405
-That was close.

412
00:48:25,973 --> 00:48:28,075
Excuse me, ladies.

413
00:48:30,477 --> 00:48:32,747
Yeah? It's not
a good time right now.

414
00:48:32,847 --> 00:48:34,582
<i>Switch on your TV.</i>

415
00:48:39,621 --> 00:48:41,321

Forgotten.

424
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,078
-Yeah. Well, apparently,
that didn't happen.

425
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:07,682

<i>You embarrass me.</i>

427
00:49:10,585 --> 00:49:12,019
Solve it.

428
00:49:16,658 --> 00:49:18,158
-Is everything okay, Dad?

429
00:49:19,561 --> 00:49:23,197
-Yeah. Yeah, everything's
gonna be okay.

430
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,502
-Okay, guys. Dig in.

431
00:49:30,772 --> 00:49:32,272
-Any progress?

432
00:49:32,372 --> 00:49:34,041
- We're working on it.

433
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:36,310
-Work faster.

434
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:39,112
-This video was uploaded
somewhere in Rome.

435
00:49:39,213 --> 00:49:41,148
We're using
the Pegasus technology

436
00:49:41,248 --> 00:49:43,651
to cross-reference
our target's facial features

437
00:49:43,751 --> 00:49:46,453
against all data retrieved.

438
00:49:46,554 --> 00:49:47,622
We will find him, sir.

439
00:49:47,722 --> 00:49:50,057
-Sir, I have something.

440
00:49:57,331 --> 00:49:59,634
- When was that?
- Three days ago.

441
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:02,670
-Call Rome.

442
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,037
Yes, sir.

443
00:52:36,924 --> 00:52:39,192
<i>The target is gone!</i>
<i>Target is gone!</i>

444
00:52:41,294 --> 00:52:42,597
-Find him!

445
00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:33,781
Okay...

446
00:53:36,784 --> 00:53:37,552
-He needs a doctor.

447
00:53:37,652 --> 00:53:38,986
-Oh, I don't need
a fucking doctor.

448
00:53:39,087 --> 00:53:40,888
Oh, behave.

449
00:53:40,988 --> 00:53:42,255
-That doesn't look too good.

450
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:44,726
No, he'll be fine.

451
00:53:44,826 --> 00:53:46,661
- Yeah.
- Just get the morphine.

452
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:49,262
Jesus.

453
00:53:49,362 --> 00:53:50,965
-The mess you get into.

454
00:53:53,467 --> 00:53:54,702
Ryder?

455
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:55,937
-Ryder.

456
00:53:56,037 --> 00:53:57,905
Stay with me.

457
00:53:58,005 --> 00:53:59,272
-Get the morphine!

458
00:53:59,372 --> 00:54:00,675
You alright?
- Yeah.

459
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,882
-I appreciate you coming, man.

460
00:54:09,817 --> 00:54:10,718
-You gotta trust me.

461
00:54:12,787 --> 00:54:14,589
-Eyes! Look at me!
Look at me!

462
00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:18,893
I'm sorry, brother.

463
00:54:20,928 --> 00:54:22,262
-No!

464
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:04,304
Ah.

465
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:06,073
Look who's finally awake.

466
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:11,746
-That's a hell of a spread
you have here.

467
00:55:13,147 --> 00:55:14,715
-It's my great escape.

468
00:55:15,783 --> 00:55:16,984
My sanctuary.

469
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:21,388
Away from lunatics
and prying eyes.

470
00:55:22,355 --> 00:55:23,791
-Tell me you don't miss it.

471
00:55:25,293 --> 00:55:26,794
-How well you know me.

472
00:55:28,629 --> 00:55:30,865
So how's the wounded
soldier feeling?

473
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:33,034
- Never better.

474
00:55:33,134 --> 00:55:35,002
Good.

475
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:36,070
-Hey.

476
00:55:37,305 --> 00:55:38,539
Thank you.

477
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,976
-Don't thank me yet.

478
00:55:42,076 --> 00:55:43,511
You haven't seen the bill.

479
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,583
Your face is all over the news.

480
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,552
You're in trouble.

481
00:55:52,419 --> 00:55:53,988
Big trouble.

482
00:55:55,056 --> 00:55:56,356
-When am I not?

483
00:55:57,592 --> 00:55:58,826
I have a plan.

484
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:04,098
-You're gonna get yourself
killed... again.

485
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:05,933
- Maybe.

486
00:56:16,177 --> 00:56:17,111
-You need me.

487
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:19,547
-I know.

488
00:56:20,548 --> 00:56:23,050
I asked. You turned me down,
remember?

489
00:56:24,952 --> 00:56:26,020
-I did.

490
00:56:33,261 --> 00:56:34,762
Don't push it, Ryder.

491
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:41,903
Come, I'll give you a tour.

492
00:56:56,951 --> 00:56:59,053
Hello, hello, hello!

493
00:56:59,153 --> 00:57:01,454
Uncle Paulie's here!

494
00:57:03,391 --> 00:57:04,859
Selina...

495
00:57:07,795 --> 00:57:10,898
Always
more beautiful by the day.

496
00:57:12,033 --> 00:57:14,168
-Thank you for doing this
at such short notice.

497
00:57:14,268 --> 00:57:15,937
-Oh, anything for you...

498
00:57:16,037 --> 00:57:17,772
and your friend.

499
00:57:17,872 --> 00:57:19,740
Come, come.
I'll show you.

500
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,342
Now this...

501
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:23,778
is the best in the market!

502
00:57:23,878 --> 00:57:25,146
Do you trust this guy?

503
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:26,981
-Oh, you have better options?

504
00:57:27,081 --> 00:57:29,083
-Self-contained pen!

505
00:57:29,183 --> 00:57:30,952
-It's either this or jail.

506
00:57:31,052 --> 00:57:32,353
-As you can see here,

507
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:33,988
orthopedic mattress
for comfort.

508
00:57:34,088 --> 00:57:37,191
We have a minibar at the back
underneath the desk

509
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:38,826
with all the whiskey
that you need.

510
00:57:38,926 --> 00:57:41,262
You also have a bathroom,
but, oh, oh, oh!

511
00:57:41,362 --> 00:57:43,931
No coco in the bathroom.
Only pee-pee.

512
00:57:44,031 --> 00:57:47,535
Now, if you want internet,
satellite encrypted connection,

513
00:57:47,635 --> 00:57:49,236
it is "Paulie's The Best,"

514
00:57:49,337 --> 00:57:53,473
Wi-Fi password,
"AteMySausage123!"

515
00:57:53,574 --> 00:57:55,676
And the best for last...

516
00:57:57,545 --> 00:58:00,114
I deliver...

517
00:58:00,214 --> 00:58:02,316
Come, come, come, come.
See, my friend. Come.

518
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:04,018
Come see.

519
00:58:13,861 --> 00:58:15,396
How long?

520
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:17,765
-We'll be there in three days.

521
00:58:19,066 --> 00:58:21,569
Just sit back and relax.

522
00:58:23,104 --> 00:58:24,972
It'll be a piece of cake.

523
00:58:30,745 --> 00:58:33,647
-Pressure mounts
on Lane Administration this week

524
00:58:33,748 --> 00:58:36,584
following the videos
of clandestine operations

525
00:58:36,684 --> 00:58:38,986
using illegal
Black-Ops mercenaries.

526
00:58:39,086 --> 00:58:41,756
This, of course,
after very public pledges

527
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:44,625
that his administration
would be different.

528
00:58:44,725 --> 00:58:46,527
-You gave me assurances.

529
00:58:46,627 --> 00:58:48,896
-You know the game.
We deny everything.

530
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:50,297
-Oh, that's it?

531
00:58:50,398 --> 00:58:51,699
That's all you have for me?

532
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:53,134
-Sir, if I may. I--

533
00:58:53,234 --> 00:58:54,602
-No, you may not.

534
00:58:54,702 --> 00:58:56,505
Be straight with me, Joshua.

535
00:58:56,604 --> 00:58:58,339
Who's behind this?

536
00:58:59,106 --> 00:59:01,909
-A disgruntled former employee.
Nothing to worry about.

537
00:59:02,009 --> 00:59:03,611
-Well, forgive me,
I do worry.

538
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:06,213
I'm the one facing the press
on a daily basis.

539
00:59:06,313 --> 00:59:08,449
You're ruining the brand.

540
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:09,950
-I'll handle the optics,

541
00:59:10,051 --> 00:59:12,019
and Hart here
will clean this mess up.

542
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:13,721
Won't you, Hart?

543
00:59:13,821 --> 00:59:16,290
-Mr. President, they're ready
for the group photo.

544
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,725
-I'll be right there.

545
00:59:18,826 --> 00:59:20,895
I should fire you both.

546
00:59:27,134 --> 00:59:28,836
-If you're serious
about your future,

547
00:59:28,936 --> 00:59:32,706
I suggest you handle this
by any means necessary.

548
00:59:35,476 --> 00:59:36,977
-There are rumors.

549
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:39,180
-What rumors?

550
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,781
-That he's on the island.

551
00:59:42,283 --> 00:59:43,250
-What?

552
00:59:44,185 --> 00:59:46,887
-He came over illegally
from Sicily.

553
00:59:46,987 --> 00:59:49,056
My men are trying
to verify it now.

554
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:57,098
-Find him before more damage
is done, understood?

555
01:00:52,253 --> 01:00:54,889
-Miss me, baby? Hmm.

556
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:57,626
-You're late.

557
01:00:57,758 --> 01:00:58,893
-Mmm.

558
01:01:03,264 --> 01:01:04,665
-Here's the rest of it.

559
01:01:07,268 --> 01:01:08,235
-Brava.

560
01:01:11,472 --> 01:01:13,307
It's not enough.

561
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:16,210
-It's what we agreed.

562
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:18,812
-Well, you did not tell me
that he was wanted

563
01:01:18,913 --> 01:01:20,781
by the fucking CIA.

564
01:01:20,881 --> 01:01:23,652
-It was none
of your fucking business.

565
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:29,524
You want to play me?

566
01:01:29,624 --> 01:01:30,958
You want to play

567
01:01:31,058 --> 01:01:34,261
the motherfucking king
of players?

568
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:35,362
Huh!?

569
01:01:46,675 --> 01:01:48,175
-We had a deal.

570
01:01:48,275 --> 01:01:50,077
-Fuck your deal!

571
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:52,446
Fuck it!

572
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:58,185
The price has tripled--

573
01:03:13,728 --> 01:03:15,162
-Motherfucker!

574
01:03:15,262 --> 01:03:17,931
-That's no way
to talk to a lady.

575
01:03:35,617 --> 01:03:37,384
-You okay?

576
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:39,019
-Aren't I always?

577
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:57,404
Room service.

578
01:03:58,707 --> 01:03:59,907
-Hey.
-I hope you're enjoying

579
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:01,743
the amenities, sir.

580
01:04:01,842 --> 01:04:03,844
-It's not exactly five-star.

581
01:04:03,944 --> 01:04:07,281
-Oh. Well, I'll be sure
to notify the staff.

582
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:08,349
Now...

583
01:04:11,952 --> 01:04:13,788
let's get to work, shall we?

584
01:04:47,955 --> 01:04:50,257
Malta is nearly
2,000 years old.

585
01:04:50,357 --> 01:04:54,027
It's seen its fair share
of wars and conquerors.

586
01:04:54,128 --> 01:04:57,498
Early Christians
built an extensive network

587
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,801
of catacombs and tunnels

588
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,936
to safeguard their faith
against the Romans.

589
01:05:03,036 --> 01:05:05,172
The tunnels
were later extended,

590
01:05:05,272 --> 01:05:07,941
covering half the island,
and later enlarged further

591
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:09,443
during World War II.

592
01:05:10,377 --> 01:05:11,945
-So the Maltese
went underground again

593
01:05:12,045 --> 01:05:13,380
to hide from the Germans.

594
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,516
-Precisely.

595
01:05:14,616 --> 01:05:15,449
-And these tunnels,

596
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:17,317
they--they're active?
They're open?

597
01:05:17,418 --> 01:05:18,520
-Indeed, they are.

598
01:05:19,687 --> 01:05:20,921
-You're clever.

599
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:22,557
-I like to think so.

600
01:05:23,323 --> 01:05:25,159
-Question is, how do we get
the target underground?

601
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:27,829
-Funny you should say that

602
01:05:27,928 --> 01:05:30,264
because that's where
your genius comes in.

603
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:24,746
-Nope, not scary at all.

604
01:07:57,177 --> 01:07:58,478
-If you miss...

605
01:08:00,915 --> 01:08:02,349
even slightly...

606
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,494
-You can trust me.

607
01:08:15,362 --> 01:08:16,864
-I've heard that before.

608
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:27,875
-I'm sorry.

609
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,114
-I know.

610
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:38,820
-I don't miss.

611
01:08:42,757 --> 01:08:44,124
I know.

612
01:09:17,257 --> 01:09:18,593
Obviously,
they're gonna have the president

613
01:09:18,693 --> 01:09:20,728
in a dedicated vehicle, right?

614
01:09:20,828 --> 01:09:21,796
-Obviously.

615
01:09:21,896 --> 01:09:24,599
-I do my thing,
gonna separate the president,

616
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,135
put him in an ambulance.

617
01:09:27,234 --> 01:09:29,637
-And if we play
our cards right,

618
01:09:29,737 --> 01:09:32,406
we grab the package,

619
01:09:32,507 --> 01:09:34,509
and deliver him
right to your door.

620
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:06,634
-What?

621
01:11:06,734 --> 01:11:09,269
<i>We have a major problem</i>
<i>on our hands.</i>

622
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:10,337
-What did you say?

623
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:13,174
-Operative 3519 has snapped.

624
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:15,308
<i>He's going for the president.</i>

625
01:11:37,131 --> 01:11:39,200
Go!

626
01:11:39,299 --> 01:11:41,368
Go, go, go!

627
01:12:16,237 --> 01:12:17,171
-Let's go! Let's go!

628
01:12:17,271 --> 01:12:18,371
-Come on! Come on! Come on!

629
01:12:18,471 --> 01:12:19,707
Get him in!

630
01:12:24,278 --> 01:12:25,513
Come on!

631
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,400
-Where did that ambulance
come from?

632
01:12:48,569 --> 01:12:50,403
Where did that ambulance
come from?

633
01:12:50,503 --> 01:12:52,740
They're kidnapping
the president!

634
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:53,774
Stay on them!

635
01:13:00,748 --> 01:13:03,150
-"Come to Malta," they said.

636
01:13:03,251 --> 01:13:04,852
"An easy mission," they said.

637
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,487
"It will be fun."

638
01:13:35,082 --> 01:13:36,717
-Stay calm, sir.

639
01:13:39,452 --> 01:13:41,188
Everything is under...

640
01:13:43,024 --> 01:13:44,424
control.

641
01:14:14,454 --> 01:14:16,090
-What the hell are they doing?

642
01:15:01,936 --> 01:15:04,538
-We have gunshots.
Repeat, we have gunshots.

643
01:15:04,638 --> 01:15:06,273
-Stay on them.

644
01:15:54,321 --> 01:15:55,589
-TBD.

645
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:43,671
-Where are they going?

646
01:17:09,598 --> 01:17:11,065
-Fire on the target.

647
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,386
-They have nowhere to run.

648
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:33,754
Keep following them.

649
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:43,197
-Brace yourself!
We're coming in hot!

650
01:18:32,647 --> 01:18:34,281
-They've gone underground.

651
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:38,752
-They could be anywhere.

652
01:18:38,852 --> 01:18:41,722
There's hundreds of tunnels
all across this island.

653
01:18:41,822 --> 01:18:43,824
We lost the president.

654
01:18:47,629 --> 01:18:48,963
- You alright?
- Yep.

655
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:14,121
Fucking shit.

656
01:19:40,749 --> 01:19:41,750
-You're late.

657
01:19:44,051 --> 01:19:46,086
Sorry. Stopped for coffee.

658
01:19:48,922 --> 01:19:50,391
-Good work, boys.

659
01:20:18,285 --> 01:20:20,888
Come. Here. Come here.
Come, come, come.

660
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:23,123
Come here.
Come on. Come on.

661
01:20:23,223 --> 01:20:25,192
Come here.

662
01:20:26,761 --> 01:20:28,730
-Okay. Let me see.
Let me see.

663
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:30,431
-I'm...
-Are you okay?

664
01:20:30,532 --> 01:20:31,899
-I'm okay.
-Look at me.

665
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:34,268
-I'm okay.
-Look at me. Look at me.

666
01:20:37,572 --> 01:20:38,606
-I got you.

667
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,743
I got you.

668
01:20:43,977 --> 01:20:45,446
-I got you.
-We did it.

669
01:20:46,748 --> 01:20:47,915
We did it.

670
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:49,216
- Yeah.
- We did it.

671
01:20:49,316 --> 01:20:52,186
We did it.

672
01:21:00,795 --> 01:21:02,262
-Come on.

673
01:21:40,835 --> 01:21:42,002
So...

674
01:21:43,937 --> 01:21:45,339
are you gonna kill me?

675
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:50,277
I don't know what you're after

676
01:21:50,377 --> 01:21:52,112
but, uh, you must know
that my country

677
01:21:52,212 --> 01:21:54,481
w-will not give in
to terrorists.

678
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,789
-All due respect, Mr. President,

679
01:22:00,889 --> 01:22:02,990
your country is littered
with terrorists.

680
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:05,225
You're American.

681
01:22:06,293 --> 01:22:07,327
-I am.

682
01:22:08,996 --> 01:22:11,666
-So what are you?
S-some kind of traitor?

683
01:22:13,934 --> 01:22:15,369
Who are you working with?

684
01:22:17,271 --> 01:22:19,339
-The United States Government,
Mr. President.

685
01:22:20,207 --> 01:22:21,643
At least I used to.

686
01:22:25,946 --> 01:22:27,080
-Under whose command?

687
01:22:27,948 --> 01:22:29,183
-Colonel Hart.

688
01:22:35,824 --> 01:22:37,391
So who the hell are you?

689
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:50,037
-I'm just a man making a stand
for his country, Mr. President.

690
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:55,375
-So what do you want from me?

691
01:22:56,977 --> 01:22:58,445
-A confession.

692
01:24:12,554 --> 01:24:14,956
I read that Greek philosophers,

693
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:16,323
the Stoics,

694
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:19,426
were virtuous people.

695
01:24:19,527 --> 01:24:22,462
Wanted to possess wisdom
and temperance,

696
01:24:22,564 --> 01:24:25,065
courage, justice.

697
01:24:25,165 --> 01:24:27,401
-Do you see yourself
as a good man?

698
01:24:28,502 --> 01:24:29,571
-I don't know.

699
01:24:32,006 --> 01:24:35,175
I hope my brother will be proud
of what we did here today.

700
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:47,889
-As politics has been rocked...

701
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:58,131
-I want to do something
that no American president

702
01:24:58,231 --> 01:25:00,602
has done in the past few years.

703
01:25:01,536 --> 01:25:03,303
I'm gonna take
full responsibility

704
01:25:03,403 --> 01:25:05,205
and tell the truth.

705
01:25:06,774 --> 01:25:08,876
As you know,
when my administration began,

706
01:25:08,977 --> 01:25:10,511
I made certain promises,

707
01:25:11,478 --> 01:25:14,314
promises that my leadership
would herald

708
01:25:14,414 --> 01:25:17,919
a new era
of international cooperation,

709
01:25:18,019 --> 01:25:19,821
harmony, and trust.

710
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:23,024
Sadly,

711
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:27,095
I failed to achieve
what I hoped to achieve

712
01:25:28,029 --> 01:25:29,631
and some of the old,

713
01:25:29,731 --> 01:25:34,167
unacceptable ways continued
under my administration.

714
01:25:35,737 --> 01:25:38,171
I have to stand before you
to admit...

715
01:25:39,907 --> 01:25:40,942
<i>that I have fallen short</i>

716
01:25:41,042 --> 01:25:44,444
<i>of what I hoped to achieve</i>
<i>for our great country.</i>

717
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:43,638
-Mother--

717
01:26:44,305 --> 01:27:44,564
